# GlobalDijkstraNet

# Description

This is a program that connects regions by the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm. It is based off of airport networks and can be used to find the shortest distance with connecting flights.
It can be used to link two airports or two regions of airports based off of input files.

# Usage
 
Requires JDK 11 to run. To run test you might need to edit file paths to the test .txt files. on lines 26, 32, and 37 of GlobalTest.java. 

Running GlobalTest.java runs the program through a cycle of given tests. Tests can be added in the same format of existing tests. 

The testing program outputs an Graph object that contains the shortest path between each region. The program can be easily edited to print to a .txt file if needed.
